# TemplesComponent

`@temples/components` turns the engine into a Web Component system. 

## Install

```sh
bun add @temples/components
```

`@temples/engine` comes as a dependency.

## How to write a web component

1. Import `TemplesComponent`, the HTML template, and the stylesheet.
2. Declare the state interface, then declare the initial state as a constant.
3. Write the class: the constructor passes the initial state to `super()`, and the handler
   methods mutate `this.state`.
4. Register the component with `TemplesComponent.define()`.

The class carries the state and the handler methods. `define()` registers the web component
and sets the HTML template, the observed attributes, and the event bindings. The component
then renders its template, reacts to state changes, and wires its events — with no framework.

**Note:** with Bun, import the template as text with `with { type: "text" }`, and import the
stylesheet directly.

The example below builds a `flipping-card`. The recto shows a title, the verso shows a hidden
text, and a click on the card flips it. It follows the same approach as the `shopping-item`
component of the example app (`example/components/shopping-item/` in the repository).

```typescript
// flipping-card.ts
import { TemplesComponent } from "@temples/components";
import template from "./flipping-card.html" with { type: "text" };

import "./flipping-card.css";

/**
 * The complete state of the card: the observed attributes, plus the
 * `flipStatus()` helper that derives the state class for the template.
 */
interface FlippingCardState {
    title: string;
    verso: string;
    flipped: boolean;
    flipStatus(): string;
}

const INITIAL_STATE: FlippingCardState = {
    title: "",
    verso: "",
    flipped: false,
    flipStatus() {
        return this.flipped ? "flipped" : "";
    }
};

/**
 * A two-sided card. The recto shows the title, the verso shows the hidden
 * text. A click on the card toggles the visible face.
 */
export class FlippingCard extends TemplesComponent<FlippingCardState> {
    constructor() {
        super(INITIAL_STATE);
    }

    /**
     * Show the verso when the card shows the recto, and the other way round.
     */
    toggle(): void {
        this.state.flipped = !this.state.flipped;
    }
}

TemplesComponent.define("flipping-card", FlippingCard, {
    template,
    attributes: { title: "string", verso: "string", flipped: "boolean" },
    events: {
        "click .card-inner": "toggle"
    }
});
```

```html
<!-- flipping-card.html -->
<div class="card-inner" data-bind="class[flipped]=flipStatus">
    <div class="face recto">
        <h3 data-bind="title">A title</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="face verso">
        <p data-bind="verso">The hidden side</p>
    </div>
</div>
```

```css
/* flipping-card.css */
flipping-card {
    display: block;
    perspective: 1000px;

    .card-inner {
        display: grid;
        cursor: pointer;
        transform-style: preserve-3d;
        transition: transform 0.6s;

        &.flipped {
            transform: rotateY(180deg);
        }
    }

    .face {
        grid-area: 1 / 1;
        backface-visibility: hidden;
        padding: 1rem;

        &.verso {
            transform: rotateY(180deg);
        }
    }
}
```

```html
<!-- usage -->
<flipping-card title="Hello World" verso="Surprise!" flipped="false"></flipping-card>
```

### Good practice: declare the state interface

The state type lists every value the component holds: the observed attributes, plus the
internal values and helpers. Declare it as an `interface` (or a `type` alias) and pass it to
the `TemplesComponent<T>` parameter. TypeScript then checks the `super()` call and every
`state` access against the same shape.

### Good practice: declare the initial state as a constant

Build the defaults once, as a typed `INITIAL_STATE` constant, and pass it to `super()`.
The constructor stays a one-liner, the defaults live in one place, and TypeScript checks the
constant against the state interface. The defaults also cover the attributes that the tag does
not declare: `connectedCallback` only reads the attributes present on the tag.

### Good practice: reflect the state with classes

Derive the state class names inside the state itself. A helper method returns the class name
when the state is active, and an empty string otherwise. The template binds it with
`data-bind="class[flipped]=flipStatus"`: the engine adds the class when the value belongs to
the `class[...]` range, and removes it otherwise. Handlers mutate `this.state` only — no
imperative `classList` calls, and the re-render follows automatically.

### Good practice: style the states with nested CSS

Scope every rule under the component tag name. Write the state classes as nested rules with
the `&` selector, next to the base styles of the same element. The state-driven styling then
reads in one place, and the class names match the template bindings.

### Define options

| Option | Role |
|--------|------|
| `template` | The HTML template string. Parsed once per class. Every instance clones it. |
| `attributes` | The observed attributes map. Each key names an attribute that flows into `state`. Each value is its coercion type: `"string"`, `"boolean"`, `"number"`, or `"json"`. |
| `events` | The event bindings map (see below). |
| `css` | Optional stylesheet text, injected when the component is used in SSR (see below). |
| `globalStore` | Optional shared store that seeds the attributes the tag does not set. |

The `attributes` map derives the class `observedAttributes` and `attributeTypes` statics, which
stay internal. A class that passes `attributes` and also declares those statics makes `define()`
throw.

## State: attributes are the source of truth

A component's data lives in `this.state`. The subclass passes its initial values to `super()`,
and the state becomes a deep reactive proxy at construction:

- Each name in the `attributes` map is read from the tag, coerced by its declared type, and
  written into `state`.
- Changing an attribute (`card.setAttribute("flipped", "true")`) updates `state` and re-renders.
- Mutating `state` (`this.state.flipped = true`) re-renders the component's bindings.

In TypeScript, the class declares its complete state shape with the `TemplesComponent<T>`
parameter, and the initial values live in an `INITIAL_STATE` constant — see the two first good
practices of the walkthrough above. The `super()` call and every `state` access are then
checked. Message payloads stay `unknown` at the bus boundary. Narrow them with a type guard
before use.
- The optional `globalStore` option seeds the attributes the tag does not set:
  `globalStore: { title: "Default" }` in the define call. An explicit attribute on the tag
  always wins over the store.

State mutation drives rendering: there is no separate `render()` call to remember.

## Events and messaging

The `events` option maps bindings to handler method names. Handlers run with `this` bound to the
component instance and receive the event, so they can call `preventDefault()`, read
`event.target.value`, and call other component methods directly.

A binding **with a space** is a DOM event: `"<eventType> <selector>"`. One shared document
listener per event type serves every component; the selector is matched inside the component's
subtree.

```javascript
events: {
    "submit .add-form": "onAdd",
    "click .flip-btn": "flip",
},

onAdd(event) {
    event.preventDefault();
    // read event.target.value, mutate this.state, ...
}
```

A binding **without a space** is an inter-component message: `"<tag>:<name>"`. Messages travel on
a shared bus, so any component can talk to any other, regardless of DOM position:

```javascript
// shopping-item.js
this.emit("updated", { id: 1, label: "Milk" }); // delivered as "shopping-item:updated"

// shopping-app.js
events: {
    "shopping-item:updated": "onUpdated",
    "shopping-item:removed": "onRemoved",
},

onUpdated(event) {
    // event.detail carries the payload
}
```

The tag prefix keeps same-named messages from different component classes apart. The `events` map
is registered on connection and unsubscribed on disconnection; `this.on(map)` adds runtime
bindings the same way.

## Styling

Components use the Light DOM — no Shadow DOM. Styles reach the component through a stylesheet
import (bundled by Bun), through the page's global styles, or through the `css` option for SSR.
Scope every rule by the component tag name, and style the component states with nested rules:

```css
flipping-card {
    perspective: 1000px;

    .card-inner {
        transition: transform 0.6s;

        &.flipped {
            transform: rotateY(180deg);
        }
    }
}
```

Do not select on the attribute (`flipping-card[flipped="true"]`). An attribute change flows
into `state`, but a state mutation does not write back to the attribute. A class bound with
`data-bind="class[...]"` always follows the state.

Light DOM keeps the component themeable with the page's CSS variables. Tag-name scoping keeps
the rules from leaking.

## Lifecycle

`TemplesComponent` implements the standard custom element lifecycle:

| Hook | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `connectedCallback` | Clones the template into the component, seeds `state` from the attributes and the global store, registers the `events` map, renders. |
| `disconnectedCallback` | Unsubscribes events and the state subscription. |
| `attributeChangedCallback` | Coerces the attribute into `state` and re-renders. |

## Components on the server

`@temples/ssr` can render component tags to their markup for static output. See
[SSR and static site generation](ssr.html).
